- Components must follow React 19 best practices. No legacy lifecycle methods or patterns.
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons.
- UI is built with `shadcn/ui`. When generating UI, use its components (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, etc.). Do not write raw HTML/CSS for elements that have a shadcn equivalent.
- Forms must be implemented using `react-hook-form` integrated with `zod` for validation.
- The `react-top-loading-bar` should be controlled by `tanstack-router` navigation events.
- For charts, use `recharts`. Ensure they are responsive and lazy-loaded.
- Use the provided `@component-template.tsx` for all new components, if present
