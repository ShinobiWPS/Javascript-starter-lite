- The project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Always generate `pnpm` commands.
- Deployment is to Vercel via a connected GitHub repository.
- Environment variables must follow the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side exposure. All other variables are server-side only.
- When creating serverless functions, be mindful of Vercel's execution time and memory limits. Keep them lean.
- All code pushed to `main` branch should be production-ready.
