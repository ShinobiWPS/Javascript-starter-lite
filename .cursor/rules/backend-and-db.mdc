- Database schema is defined and managed with Drizzle. All queries must be type-safe using the Drizzle ORM. Do not write raw SQL.
- Authentication is handled by `better-auth`. Use its provided functions for session management and user authentication.
- Web3 login is managed by `Reown` and `wagmi`. Ensure connectors are configured correctly and hooks are used as intended.
- Use `date-fns` for all date/time manipulations. Do not use the native `Date` object directly for formatting or time-zone-sensitive operations.
