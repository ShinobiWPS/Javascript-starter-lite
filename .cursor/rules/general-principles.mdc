- Prioritize maintainability, robust error handling, and extendibility.
- Leverage web-native APIs (e.g., Fetch API, URL, Intl) before adding a library.
- After implementing a solution, perform a self-critique: does it compromise our core principles? If yes, propose an alternative.
- All code must adhere to the best practices of the specific language and framework version used.
- Use functional and declarative programing patterns; avoid
classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. ,
isLoading, hasError) .
- Do not run TS checks.
- do not run builds.
